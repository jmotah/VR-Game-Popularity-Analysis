    "### Introduction\n",
    "Virtual Reality has been rapidly revolutionizing gaming by providing the most immersive experiences, allowing users to engage inside of digital environments in a deeply interactive way. Despite VR growing in popularity, developers need a clear understanding of what's driving engagement to create a more compelling audience. For the project I want to focus on identifying the key factors which affect user engagement in VR games and answering these questions. \n",

    "### Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this project is collected directly from Steamâ€™s website using web scraping. Steam is the largest digital distribution platform for PC gaming. Then I will use BeautifulSoup to extract additional information from specifically data-tooltip-html into Python.  So far I have created a function which gathers some of the top rated VR games. Later, I will create another function which will go in depth on number of reviews, price, and genre. "

    "### Data Usage\n",
    "The data collected from Steam, including game names, prices, number of reviews, and positive review percentage will be used to explore key factors that will influence user engagement in VR games. One feature key part of data I am wanting to integrate into the function is genres, which I believe is very important in differentiating the types of games. One hicup is that the search does not have genre's provided, so I may need to make another function to extract genre data from the actual store-page. I also added platforms later on as I believed it was important in seeing if supporting more platforms than just windows could affect popularity. By analyzing relationships between these features, predicting future shifts where gaming and Virtual Reality itself could be possible. But importantly, improving user engagement will be more likely in bettering VR as a whole.\n"
